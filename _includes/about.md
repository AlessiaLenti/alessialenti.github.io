I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Art History at the University of Genoa and I graduated in the three-year course of Comic Art at Scuola Chiavarese del Fumetto of Sestri Levante.
Passionate of music, cinema and of course art, I found in comics and illustration the adequate means to express myself, to combine graphic arts and narration, form and subject.
Currently, I'm preparing projects for publication.
I also realize works on commission.
Enjoy!
