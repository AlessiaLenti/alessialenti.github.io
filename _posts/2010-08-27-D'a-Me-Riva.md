description: I made this illustration for the II edition of Albissola Comics Contest. I took inspiration from the beautiful and touching Fabrizio De Andr√®'s song "D'a me riva", written in Genoese dialect. In this song, a Genoese sailor has to separate from his girl and his beloved city, Genoa. Genoese sailor's objects are the real protagonists of the illustration and show the presence-absence of the sailor, that is sadly thinking about what he has close to his heart while he's leaving.
Ink on paper.
