description: I made this illustration for the II edition of Albissola Comics Contest. I took inspiration from the beautiful and touching Fabrizio de Andr√®'s song "D'a me riva", in which a Genoese sailor has to separate from his girl and his beloved city, Genoa. His objects are the real protagonists of the illustration, because they show the presence-absence oh the sailor, who is sadly thinking about what he has close to his heart.
